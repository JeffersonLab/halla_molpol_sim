# File Organization Rules

## Directory Structure
- All header files (`.hh`) go in `include/` directory
- All source files (`.cc`) go in `src/` directory
- Main executable file `MolPol.cc` stays in project root
- Macro files (`.mac`) go in `macros/` directory
- Visualization macros go in `vis/` directory
- Python scripts go in `scripts/` directory
- Shell scripts can be in `macros/` or `scripts/` directories

## File Naming
- C++ classes: `MolPol[ClassName].cc` and `MolPol[ClassName].hh`
- Macros: descriptive names with `.mac` extension
- Scripts: descriptive names with appropriate extension (`.sh`, `.pl`, `.py`)

## Project Structure
- This is a GEANT4 and ROOT application
- Simulation is in GEANT4
- Output is in ROOT file format
- Codebase is primarily C++ (GEANT4/ROOT standard)
