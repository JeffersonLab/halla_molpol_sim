The output trees are organized into several indepdent arrays

ev.*  - generated particle info, one entry per particle
hit.* - detector hits

ev.npart        number of generated particles
ev.pid		Geant4 particle type
ev.v[xyz]	creation vertex, lab frame [m]
ev.p		Particle initial momentum [GeV]
ev.p[xyz]	Particle initial momentum components, lab frame [GeV]
ev.th		Particle initial polar angle [rad]
ev.ph		Particle initial azimuthal angle [rad]
ev.thcom	Particle initial polar angle in CM frame
